    <h2 class="recipetitle">Description</h2>
    <p class="text">A Brazilian chocolate truffle garnished with sprinkles</p>

    <h2 class="recipetitle">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="text">
        <li>Cocoa Powder</li>
        <li>Unsalted Butter</li>
        <li>Condensed Milk</li>
        <li>Sprinkles</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="recipetitle">Steps</h3>
    <ol class="text">
        <li>Mix the condensed milk, the butter, and the cocoa powder in a medium non-stick pan in low heat. Be sure to continually stir with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula so the milk won’t burn at the bottom.</li>
        <li>Turn off the stove after the mixture seems more like a dough and it starts pulling away from the sides of the pan</li>
        <li>Remove it from the heat and transfer the mixture to the greased plate and spread. Let it cool in the freezer for 25 minutes.</li>        
        <li>Before you start molding your brigadeiros, put the chocolate sprinkles on a plate next to you, another plate filled with candy cups, and butter to grease your hands a little.</li>
        <li>To mold the brigadeiro into balls, take a full teaspoon with the dough and roll it between your buttered hands. Put the little balls on the plate with sprinkles, but don’t coat it yet.</li>
        <li>After you have no more space on the plate or there’s no more dough, roll the brigadeiros around the plate with sprinkles to coat all sides and transfer each ball to a candy cup.</li>



    </ol>
